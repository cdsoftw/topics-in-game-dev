# TopicsInGameDev
This repository contains source code I used in my research project for my Topics of Game Development class at the University of North Texas.

Using HTML5 and CSS, I created 5 different versions of a Breakout clone, each designed to have  varying degrees of perceived effectance and control, then designed and implemented a within-subjects research study that had each of the 29 participants play the 5 versions in random order and complete a survey about their experience afterwards.

My research was based on a paper by Klimmt et al. My findings were mostly consistent with theirs, i.e., reduced effectance and control causes reduced enjoyment.
